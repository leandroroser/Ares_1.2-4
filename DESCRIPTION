Description: Generates an allelic richness accumulation curve. This
        curve shows the expected number of unique alleles in a
        population when taking a sample of individuals. The function
        aresCalc takes an abundance data matrix as input, showing the
        abundance of each alleles in the individuals, and gives an accumulation
        curve (mean with 95\% confidence bounds) back. The function
        aresPlot can be used to plot the output from aresCalc.
